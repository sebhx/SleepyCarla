# Sleep Info Visualization Improvement

## Summary

Enhanced the sleep timeline cards to use icons alongside times for much clearer visual communication of sleep and wake events.

## Before (Text + Time Only)

```
Nap
21:41 → 22:11
```

Problems:

- "Nap" text but no "Wake" label
- Inconsistent information display
- Not immediately clear what the second time represents

## After (Icons + Times)

```
Nap
[Moon Icon] 21:41 → [Sun Icon] 22:11
```

Or for ongoing sessions:

```
Night Sleep
[Bed Icon] 21:41 → [Clock Icon] In progress
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Visual Clarity

- **Sleep Icon**: Moon (nap) or Bed (night sleep) + start time
- **Wake Icon**: Sun + wake time
- **Ongoing Icon**: Clock + "In progress" text

### 2. Consistent Information

- Both sleep and wake events now have clear visual indicators
- Icons immediately communicate the action type
- Times are properly labeled with context

### 3. Baby-Themed Design

- Playful icons perfect for a baby app
- Intuitive symbols (Moon = sleep, Sun = wake up)
- Language-independent visual communication

## Implementation Details

### Template Structure

```vue
<div class="sleep-times">
  <div class="time-item sleep-start-item">
    <Moon/Bed :size="16" color="var(--baby-blue)" />
    <span class="start-time">21:41</span>
  </div>

  <span class="time-separator">→</span>

  <div class="time-item wake-item">
    <Sun :size="16" color="var(--baby-orange)" />
    <span class="wake-time">22:11</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Features

- **Flexible Layout**: Uses flexbox with proper gaps
- **Icon-Text Pairing**: Each time has its contextual icon
- **Mobile Responsive**: Stacks vertically on small screens
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for sleep vs wake
- **Consistent Spacing**: Proper gaps between elements

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Immediate Understanding**: Icons make it instantly clear what each time represents
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Better organized information flow
3. **Accessibility**: Icons supplement text for better comprehension
4. **Consistency**: Same pattern across all sleep sessions
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Works well on small screens

## Files Modified

- `src/features/sleep-tracking/components/SleepTimeline.vue`
- Updated template structure with icon-time pairs
- Enhanced CSS for better layout and spacing
- Maintained responsive design and all functionality

This change significantly improves the user experience by making sleep session information much more intuitive and visually appealing.
