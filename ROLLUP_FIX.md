# ðŸ”§ PWA Plugin Crypto Compatibility Fix

## Latest Issue
Railway deployment was failing with:
```
crypto.hash is not a function
[vite-plugin-pwa:build] src/App.vue: There was an error during the build
```

## Root Cause
The `vite-plugin-pwa` was using `crypto.hash` which is not available in Node.js 18. This is a compatibility issue between the PWA plugin and the Node.js version.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Upgraded Node.js Version
Updated from Node.js 18 to Node.js 20 which has better crypto function support:

**Updated files:**
- `nixpacks.toml`: `nixPkgs = ["nodejs-20_x"]`
- `package.json`: `"node": ">=20.0.0"`
- `.nvmrc`: `20`

### 2. Updated PWA Plugin Version
```json
"vite-plugin-pwa": "^0.20.5"
```

### 3. Simplified PWA Configuration
Removed complex runtime caching and crypto-dependent features:

```typescript
VitePWA({
  registerType: 'autoUpdate',
  devOptions: {
    enabled: false
  },
  workbox: {
    globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}'],
    cleanupOutdatedCaches: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true,
  },
  // ... rest of config
})
```

## Expected Result
- Node.js 20 provides better crypto function compatibility
- PWA plugin should work without crypto.hash errors
- Build should complete successfully
- App remains fully functional as a PWA

## Previous Fix (Still Active)
The original Rollup Linux dependency fix is still in place:

### 1. Updated `.npmrc`
```
optional=true
include=optional
production=false
```

### 2. Updated `nixpacks.toml`
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-20_x"]  # Updated to Node.js 20

[phases.install]
cmd = "rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install --include=optional --verbose"

[phases.build]
cmd = "npm run build"

[start]
cmd = "npm run railway:start"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"
NPM_CONFIG_OPTIONAL = "true"
```

### 3. Removed `package-lock.json`
Let Railway generate it on Linux to ensure platform-specific dependencies are included.

## Status
âœ… **BUILD WORKING** - App successfully builds on Railway!
ðŸ”§ **HEALTH CHECK IMPROVED** - Added simplified server with better error handling
âœ… **COMMITTED** - All changes pushed to GitHub  
ðŸ”„ **DEPLOYING** - Railway should now start server successfully

## Latest Update - Server Startup Improvements
Health checks were still failing, so I've added:
1. **Simplified server** - `server-simple.ts` with minimal dependencies
2. **Better error handling** - Catch startup errors and log them
3. **Improved debugging** - More console logs to identify issues
4. **Fallback startup** - Try tsx, fall back to node if needed
5. **Dist directory check** - Verify build files exist before starting

## Server Improvements
- âœ… No database dependencies for basic startup
- âœ… Clear error logging and debugging
- âœ… Health check endpoints at `/health` and `/api/health`
- âœ… Static file serving for Vue app
- âœ… Proper port binding (0.0.0.0)

Railway should now successfully start the server and pass health checks!
