# ðŸ”§ Rollup Linux Dependency Fix

## Issue
Railway deployment was failing with:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

## Root Cause
Rollup requires platform-specific optional dependencies that weren't being installed properly in the Railway Linux environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.npmrc`
```
optional=true
include=optional
production=false
```

### 2. Updated `nixpacks.toml`
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]

[phases.install]
cmd = "rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install --include=optional --verbose"

[phases.build]
cmd = "npm run build"

[start]
cmd = "npm run railway:start"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"
NPM_CONFIG_OPTIONAL = "true"
```

### 3. Removed `package-lock.json`
Let Railway generate it on Linux to ensure platform-specific dependencies are included.

## Expected Result
- Railway will install all optional dependencies including `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`
- Vite build will complete successfully
- Deployment should proceed without Rollup errors

## Next Steps
1. Railway should automatically deploy with these changes
2. Check deployment logs for successful build
3. Verify the app is accessible at your Railway URL

## If Still Failing
If the issue persists, the fallback is to:
1. Use a different bundler (like esbuild)
2. Or configure Vite to use a different rollup configuration
3. Or pin to an older version of Vite/Rollup that doesn't have this issue

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
ðŸ”„ **DEPLOYING** - Railway should automatically redeploy
