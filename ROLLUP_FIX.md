# 🔧 PWA Plugin Crypto Compatibility Fix

## Latest Issue
Railway deployment was failing with:
```
crypto.hash is not a function
[vite-plugin-pwa:build] src/App.vue: There was an error during the build
```

## Root Cause
The `vite-plugin-pwa` was using `crypto.hash` which is not available in Node.js 18. This is a compatibility issue between the PWA plugin and the Node.js version.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Upgraded Node.js Version
Updated from Node.js 18 to Node.js 20 which has better crypto function support:

**Updated files:**
- `nixpacks.toml`: `nixPkgs = ["nodejs-20_x"]`
- `package.json`: `"node": ">=20.0.0"`
- `.nvmrc`: `20`

### 2. Updated PWA Plugin Version
```json
"vite-plugin-pwa": "^0.20.5"
```

### 3. Simplified PWA Configuration
Removed complex runtime caching and crypto-dependent features:

```typescript
VitePWA({
  registerType: 'autoUpdate',
  devOptions: {
    enabled: false
  },
  workbox: {
    globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}'],
    cleanupOutdatedCaches: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true,
  },
  // ... rest of config
})
```

## Expected Result
- Node.js 20 provides better crypto function compatibility
- PWA plugin should work without crypto.hash errors
- Build should complete successfully
- App remains fully functional as a PWA

## Previous Fix (Still Active)
The original Rollup Linux dependency fix is still in place:

### 1. Updated `.npmrc`
```
optional=true
include=optional
production=false
```

### 2. Updated `nixpacks.toml`
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-20_x"]  # Updated to Node.js 20

[phases.install]
cmd = "rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install --include=optional --verbose"

[phases.build]
cmd = "npm run build"

[start]
cmd = "npm run railway:start"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"
NPM_CONFIG_OPTIONAL = "true"
```

### 3. Removed `package-lock.json`
Let Railway generate it on Linux to ensure platform-specific dependencies are included.

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Reverted to Node.js 18 and compatible PWA plugin version
✅ **COMMITTED** - All changes pushed to GitHub  
🔄 **DEPLOYING** - Railway should auto-detect Node.js 18 and use compatible dependencies

## Latest Approach
Since Railway had issues with Node.js 20 package names, we've:
1. **Removed `nixpacks.toml`** - Let Railway auto-detect everything
2. **Reverted to Node.js 18** - More stable for Railway deployments
3. **Used compatible PWA plugin version** - `^0.19.8` works with Node.js 18
4. **Kept `.npmrc`** - Ensures optional dependencies are still installed

Railway should now use:
- Node.js 18 (from package.json engines)
- Compatible PWA plugin that doesn't use crypto.hash
- Proper optional dependency installation
- Auto-detected build configuration
