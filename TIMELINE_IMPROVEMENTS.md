# Updated Sleep Timeline Component

## Changes Made Based on Feedback

### 1. ✅ Sun Icon Color Fixed

- Changed wake-up events from `--baby-yellow` to `--baby-orange`
- Sun icons now display in a proper orange color

### 2. ✅ Proper Timeline Appearance

- Added **main timeline line** running vertically through all events
- Timeline line has a gradient from baby-blue to baby-purple
- Individual event icons now properly align with the timeline
- Events no longer look like chat bubbles

### 3. ✅ Manual Entry Display Fixed

- Duration badges now appear on both sleep start events (for manual entries) and wake events
- Duration badges use orange theme for better visibility
- Notes only show on sleep start events to avoid duplication
- Better visual hierarchy for manual entries with duration and notes
